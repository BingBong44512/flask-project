THINKFUL

Everyday a new textbook sentence is released. Either you try your hardest to recall your high-school education, or learn the lesson with the provided link and see how much went over your head.

Everyday, you will be given a passage missing its key terms and through a dropdown menu, you will be able to select possible options from a list. Then you can check to see if your answers are correct through a button. 

You can either start reading the passage, or go even further by clicking the link to gain more in depth information on that topic.

Each day the lessons will progress, in astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology, swapping out each subject everyday.

Altogether, you will become more thinkful®  everyday.
