Whether the acceleration\u00a0a\u00a0should be taken as\u00a0+g\u00a0or\u00a0\u2212g\u00a0is determined by your choice of coordinate system. Since acceleration is constant, the kinematic equations above can be applied with the appropriate\u00a0+g\u00a0or\u00a0\u2212g substituted for\u00a0a.

In one-dimensional, or straight-line, motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign. In two dimensions (2-d), however, we specify the direction of a vector relative to some reference frame (i.e., coordinate system), using an arrow having length proportional to the vector\u2019s magnitude and pointing in the direction of the vector."

Relative velocity is the velocity of an object as observed from a particular reference frame, and it varies dramatically with reference frame. Relativity is the study of how different observers measure the same phenomenon, particularly when the observers move relative to one another. Classical relativity is limited to situations where speed is less than about 1% of the speed of light (3000 km/s)."
